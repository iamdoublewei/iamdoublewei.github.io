## Efficient machine learning systems <a name="mlsys"></a>
My current research focuses on efficient algorithm design and mapping on existing computing platforms such as FPGA and GPU. [Medusa](https://sites.google.com/view/medusa-llm) is a easy-to-use framework which accelerates LLM generation through multiple light-weighted decoding head. The overhead is much smaller than that of the draft model based speculative decoding design. 
My [DAC22](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03646) paper is a Transformer-based model mapping on FPGA which features sequence-length adaptive hardware design and re-designed linear complexity self-attention. My [ICCAD23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11825) paper is a GNN mapping on GPU which features degree sorting, block-level partition and combined warp on GPU CUDA kernel, which maximizes GPU memory bandwidth and computational parallelism on SpMM operator.
