I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://sciences.utsa.edu/computer-science/) at [The University of Texas at San Antonio](https://www.utsa.edu/), 
where I began my doctoral studies in 2020. Prior to that, I worked as a Software Development Engineer for three years. I received my M.S. degree in Computer Engineering from The University of Texas at San Antonio in 2017.

My research interests include over-the-air (OTA) updates and Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) in energy harvesting Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
